Expanding on your points:

1. This is a Web App that gives information about a certain tradition. Nowadays, people are very ignorant of their traditions. The Web App serves as a valuable tool to assist South Africans in rediscovering and reconnecting with their cultural roots. In today's fast-paced world, it's all too common for people to lose touch with their heritage, and this platform aims to bridge that knowledge gap.

2. People who lack knowledge about the topic of traditions often discriminate against those who embrace their cultural heritage. Unfortunately, in contemporary society, the younger generation often views following traditions as old-fashioned and uninteresting, leading to instances of peer pressure and bullying. This discrimination based on cultural differences is a concerning issue that the Web App seeks to address.

3. The Web application goes beyond merely providing information; it offers comprehensive explanations of the diverse cultures present in South Africa. Each cultural explanation is accompanied by tangible examples of the traditions associated with that culture. By delving into the historical practices and beliefs of their ancestors, individuals gain a deeper understanding of their own roots and the roots of others. This enhanced understanding promotes unity and empathy, ultimately reducing discrimination and fostering a more inclusive society.

4. The target audience for this Web App comprises two groups: those who have faced discrimination due to their traditions and those who have discriminated against others because they lack knowledge about different traditions. Individuals who have experienced discrimination often feel like outsiders in their own communities and yearn for acceptance. They hope that others will become more open-minded when it comes to the topic of traditions.

On the other hand, those who have treated others poorly due to their lack of knowledge need to educate themselves about different traditions. By gaining this knowledge, they can develop empathy for people from diverse backgrounds and learn to appreciate the richness of cultural diversity.

5. The Web App is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Flask, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience. It incorporates images that visually represent various traditions and includes concise paragraph explanations to make the content easily digestible and engaging for users.

6. To gauge the success of the Web App, product metrics will be utilized. These metrics will assess various characteristics of the product, including its size, complexity, design features, performance, and overall quality level. By analyzing these metrics, you can continually improve the Web App to better serve its mission of promoting cultural awareness, reducing discrimination, and fostering a sense of belonging among South Africans.
