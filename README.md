This is a Web App that gives
information about a certain tradition.
Nowadays people are very ignorant
of their traditions. The Web App
assists South Africans to know their
roots.
2. People who lack knowledge
about the topic of traditions often
discriminate those with knowledge.
The sad part is that the generation of
today think that following our
traditions is old fashioned and boringso they start bullying their peers
when they follow their traditions.
3. The Web application gives an
explanation of the different cultures
in South Africa. Every explanation has
an example of the tradition given.
The Web App gives individuals more
knowledge about our ancestors and
how they used to live. That will help
people understand themselves and
each other on a deeper level thus
reducing the discrimination against
each other.4. My target audience is people who
have been discriminated due to their
traditions and people who
discriminated others due to the lack
of knowledge about the other’s
traditions.
Individuals being discriminated
against need to be accepted by the
community because they feel like
they don’t fit in. They just want other
people to be open minded when it
comes to the topic of traditions.
People that are treating others badly
need to learn more about other
traditions and not only their own sothat they may have empathy towards
others.
5. The Web App includes Html, CSS
and Flask. It includes images and
brief paragraph explanations.
6. I will be using the Product metrics
which looks at the characteristics of
the product such as size, complexity,
design features, performance and
the quality level.
