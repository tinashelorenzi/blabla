Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 1000000 simulations performed more tests

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000000 simulations would be more accurate and takes more time to compute
